### OPTIONAL: Example of Client-Side Code Update

If you have a client-side JavaScript file that connects to your server using Socket.IO, you would update the connection URL to use the ngrok URL:

```javascript
// Original connection to local server
// const socket = io("http://localhost:3000");

// Updated connection to use ngrok URL
const socket = io("http://abcd1234.ngrok.io");
```    


## Starting the program AS A TESTER

After the developer has started ngrok, and shared their url, copy the url and type in web browswer window,   
something like:
